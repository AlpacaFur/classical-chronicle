This is the first installment in a new series of the culture section of the Classical Chronicle called "Album of the Week." Created as a way to introduce readers to new music and expand tastes, it will hopefully feature songs from a vast array of genres and artists. 

This week's album comes from senior, Joseph Chirinos. It is 'Ramona Park Broke My Heart' by American rapper and NAACP Image Award Winner, Vince Staples. The fifth studio album of the artist, it features themes driven by a lost troubled youth and a dissonance between wanting to revisit days past but also remembering them as fraught with harship.

Aside from the witty lyrics loaden with symbolism, Staples' voice take on a fatigued cadence, seemingly drained from even recounting his memories. 

When asked about his thoughts on the album, Chirinos had this to say, "...it's presented in this trap music and mainstream sound but this shit is SAD."

Though composed of many exceptional songs, the undisputed masterpiece is 'When Sparks Fly,' a song so catchy most people probably don't listen to the lyrics. But they should. Becuase its not just about the siren nature of the complex bond that hood culture has with its particpants: appealing yet ultimately dooming, its also a personal statement about the artist themselves.

Chirinos futrther elaborates on the themes of the album and how the hood is portrayed

*"The hood is such a toxic relationship because its home. Its comforting but also deprecating to involve yourself in that culture. The last line of the interlude, Nameless is, "you can't take all with us," he wants to leave it behind, but part of him also wants to be proud of where he's from."

In all, 'Ramona Park Broke My Heart' is an interesting look into one man's relationship with his background that also serves as a holistic insight into hood culture. For fans of Vince Staples or rap in general, this album is definitely a must listen.
