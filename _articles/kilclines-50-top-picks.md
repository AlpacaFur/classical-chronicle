Hi, I am Owen Kilcline and I listen to music a lot, so I made a playlist of my favorite songs of all time. All of these songs are from albums I believe to be the best of the best, so I limited myself to one song per album so this playlist wouldn't be 500 songs long. So, if you are interested, have fun listening!

# Personal Favorites:

## Nights - <span style="font-weight:normal">Frank Ocean</span>

Frank Ocean pours all of his emotions into a beautifully structured song distinctly separated into two segments by its climax in the middle. Known as the "Nights Beat Switch," it’s absolutely one of the greatest musical beat switches of all time. The song slowly builds up to a moment that feels like a breath of fresh air, which you need to listen to yourself to understand.

## POWER - <span style="font-weight:normal">Kanye West</span>

The first single of Kanye's 2010 masterpiece, "My Beautiful Dark Twisted Fantasy." West throws you into his world, sampling from 21st Century Schizoid Man by King Crimson and Afromerica by Continent Number 6. It was released right after the infamous Taylor Swift VMAs incident, when he ran up on stage after drinking a bottle of Hennessy to discredit Taylor Swift winning an award for Best Video by a Female Artist. "POWER" touches on the issues of celebrity worship and how life is in the spotlight of the world, and marks Kanye's comeback from a seemingly endless pit.

## Bodys - <span style="font-weight:normal">Car Seat Headrest</span>

This song is from Car Seat Headrest's sixth studio album: "Twin Fantasy" (2018 version). It’s a six minute long trip into emotion: nostalgic in a way that makes you both happy and sad, while the lyrics tap into a more sensitive, awkward side as lead singer Will Toledo argues with himself and breaks the fourth wall. The instrumentals flow in, the verses build up, all of the vocals flood in, and then one of the best choruses of all time hits you like a truck.

### Honorable Mentions:  

*B.O.B.(Bombs Over Baghdad)* - OutKast

*Sibling Rivalry - PUP*

*Freeee(Ghost Town Pt. 2)* - KIDS SEE GHOSTS
