Thank you so much for asking & for not assuming. My daughter most certainly did not say the n-word, nor did she even mouth it. She & I agree that it’s not a word any white person should say, given the history of the word. She’d be happy to sign your petition.

Like a lot of teens do, she made a tik tok of herself lip syncing so a song she liked when she was bored. She thought the line about money in the song was cool. Since the n-word was in the song (& and happens to be in many popular songs today) she intentionally & deliberately did not move her lips to that part. Her lips literally do not mouth that word, even if her mouth is not closed.

I think this is an instance where rumors distort the truth, so I commend you on inquiring & not jumping to conclusions. I would highly suggest watching the video for yourself with an open mind so that you can make a more accurate assessment.

I can assure you that no child of mine has ever used racist language.

Please let me know if you have any further questions.

I’d also like to encourage you to talk to Eliora directly in real life. I know Athena approached her & they had a very productive conversation.
