Social Media plays a big part in teenagers’ lives and time. Social Media is full of many great resources and things that can help and guide teenagers since most of us nowadays are in our bed scrolling through tiktok and instagram and relating to relatable tweets from twitter. Other than that it can be great to have some great resources and inspirations that can just be found in a simple insta account to help us for educational purposes and guide us with our mental health. The following Instagram accounts are my favorite sources of many unique educational and mental health related content.  

**@education**  
This is a very helpful education account. Although it is relatively new, with a mere 14 posts, this account still gives out essential and inspirational information that can inspire students to strive and work harder. One of their more viral posts, with 276 likes, is a little animation picture about how you may never succeed in your first try and in their words “but you can't make your 50th without making your 1st. So, get it over with and *** make it happen”. 

**@daily_math_**  
In contrast, this educational account has over 105k followers. It’s very helpful for math and can help students strive at their math skills, because I know how hard and annoying math can be sometimes. This account also sometimes honors people who made a big impact with math or to math. One of their more recent posts talks about the mean value theorem. 

**@zinneducationproject**  
This educational account on instagram is a project centered around history. The Thai account gives very resourceful and good history facts that we as students may not know ourselves. One of their posts talks about Ethiopia and its fight against Facism.

**@selfloveblossom**  
This Instagram account with over 450k followers talks about mental health with its frequencies and active posting of quotes which can inspire teenagers and possibly make someone's day. The appropriately chosen name gives off “kind” vibes, fitting the purpose of the account. One of my personal favorite posts from them includes a quote stating “Sometimes you don't get what you want because you deserve better.”

**@letstalk.mentalhealth**  
Last, but definitely not least, is this account on Instagram that is a mixture of education and mental health. This probably has to be my favorite out of all the suggestions. This account talks about things like “toxic positivity” and “benefits of meditation” which we as teenagers may not know much about. This account is very inspirational and informational, and also very followed, with 960k followers. This account may be the perfect one for you. They post informational posts everyday which can include daily affirmations or a mental health education. One of their posts talks about things to say to someone that is struggling, whether it’s personal or school related. 

Many parents and teachers may think that social media applications like Instagram aren't helpful to a student's everyday life, but in reality apps like this can help, guide, and inspire today's generation to move forward.
