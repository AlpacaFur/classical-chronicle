The Classical Chronicle is Classical's school newspaper. With many student submitted articles, on a variety of topics, we help keep the student body up to date on timely events. We also maintain this club directory and the [daily schedule tool](/schedule/). If you want to write an article, whether independently or with the help of one of our editors, we'd be more than happy to have you.
