'''
Running this file will clear the current _staff directory and refill it using the staff.csv file
Each entry will create a new markdown file, named after the entry's lastName attribute
Verify that all values and column names can be handled by the site's code:
If a member's 'department' is not in _data/departments.yml, the member will not appear on the site's staff directory.
Feel free to add departments to _data/departments.yml, following the syntax already layed out
